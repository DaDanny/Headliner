3. **Launch** Headliner and follow the guided onboarding process
4. **Install** the system extension when prompted
5. **Grant** camera permissions when requested

## Usage

### First Time Setup

Headliner features a streamlined 4-step onboarding process:

1. **Welcome** - Overview and expectations (takes ~2 minutes)
2. **System Extension** - Automatic installation with clear explanations
3. **Camera Setup** - Device selection and overlay preset choice
4. **Personalization** - Display name, tagline, and optional location services

The onboarding only appears when the system extension isn't installed. Once installed, you'll go straight to the main app on subsequent launches.

### Using Headliner in Video Apps

2. Go to video/camera settings
3. Select "Headliner" as your camera source
4. You should now see your Headliner camera feed (with overlays if enabled)

- **Personal**: Info pill with location/time/weather at top-left
- **Clean**: No overlays - just your camera feed
- **Creative**: Coming soon - advanced overlay options

### Controls

### Key Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework with comprehensive previews
- **CoreMediaIO**: Camera extension APIs
- **AVFoundation**: Camera capture and video processing
- **SystemExtensions**: System extension management
- **CoreLocation**: Location services for weather overlays
- **WeatherKit**: Apple's weather service with Open-Meteo fallback

## Privacy

Headliner processes all video locally on your device. No video data is transmitted to external servers.

**Required Permissions:**

- **Camera**: Required for virtual camera functionality
- **Location** (optional): Used for displaying city and local time in overlays

Weather data is fetched from either Apple's WeatherKit service or the open-source Open-Meteo API. All permissions can be revoked at any time through System Settings > Privacy & Security.
