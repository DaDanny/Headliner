# Camera Extension Refactor Plan - Final Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis from four independent reviews, this refactor addresses the **fundamental architectural flaw**: dual camera access conflicts between the main app and extension. While the overlay system works correctly, there are critical performance and reliability issues that need fixing.

**Current Status**: ✅ Overlays work, Google Meet integration functional, real-time overlay updates work
**Problems**: 🚨 Performance issues, dual camera conflicts, unreliable state management, unnecessary complexity

## Core Architectural Principle

**Extension owns camera exclusively. Main app shows self-preview from virtual camera.**

```
Physical Camera → Extension Only → Virtual Camera Device → External Apps (Meet/Zoom)
                                                        ↘
                                                          Main App Self-Preview
```

This eliminates device conflicts and ensures perfect preview accuracy.

## Root Issues Identified (Consensus from All Analyses)

### 1. **Dual Camera Access Conflict** 🚨🚨 (All 4 analyses)
- Main app `CaptureSessionManager` competes with extension `CaptureSessionManager`
- Only one process can access camera device at a time on macOS
- Causes device conflicts, especially during Google Meet video toggles

### 2. **Immediate Camera Initialization** 🚨🚨 (3/4 analyses)
- Extension calls `setupCaptureSession()` in `init()` 
- Camera starts on app launch even when not needed
- Wastes resources, shows camera indicator unnecessarily

### 3. **State Management Chaos** 🚨 (All 4 analyses)
- Complex dual state: `_streamingCounter` vs `_isAppControlledStreaming`
- `stopStreaming()` incorrectly resets app-controlled state
- No reliable app-extension status communication
- Hardcoded delays instead of proper acknowledgments

### 4. **Redundant Manager Classes** ⚠️ (3/4 analyses)
- `CustomPropertyManager`: Returns placeholder IDs, adds no value
- `OutputImageManager`: Single property wrapper, unnecessary indirection
- Can be eliminated or folded into existing services

### 5. **Unreliable Communication** ⚠️ (3/4 analyses)
- One-way Darwin notifications without acknowledgments
- App assumes success after arbitrary timeouts
- No health checks or recovery mechanisms

## Refactor Plan - Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical Architecture Fix (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Eliminate Dual Camera Access
**Goal**: Extension becomes sole camera owner

**Main App Changes**:
- Remove all `CaptureSessionManager` usage from main app
- `CameraService` does device enumeration only (no capture)
- Device selection saves to UserDefaults, no direct camera access

**Extension Changes**:
- Remove `setupCaptureSession()` from `init()` - implement lazy initialization
- Start camera only when: external app requests virtual camera OR user clicks "Start Camera"

**Files to Modify**:
- `CameraService.swift`: Remove capture session, keep device enumeration
- `CameraExtensionProvider.swift`: Remove init-time camera setup
- `OutputImageManager.swift`: Delete or repurpose

#### 1.2 Implement Self-Preview Architecture
**Goal**: Main app preview shows exactly what Google Meet sees

**Implementation**:
- Main app captures from "Headliner" virtual camera device for live preview
- User sees identical output to external apps (perfect accuracy)
- No complex IPC or shared memory needed

**Files to Modify**:
- `CameraService.swift`: Preview captures from virtual camera device
- `CameraPreviewCard.swift`: Update to use virtual camera as source

#### 1.3 Fix State Management in Extension
**Goal**: Prevent Google Meet toggle issues

**Critical Fix**:
```swift
func stopStreaming() {
    if _streamingCounter > 1 {
        _streamingCounter -= 1
    } else {
        _streamingCounter = 0
        
        // Stop timer-based frame generation
        if let timer = _timer {
            timer.cancel()
            _timer = nil
        }
        
        // ❌ REMOVE THIS LINE - Don't reset app state when external apps stop
        // _isAppControlledStreaming = false  
        
        // Only stop camera if app explicitly wants it stopped
        _streamStateLock.lock()
        let shouldStopCamera = !_isAppControlledStreaming
        _streamStateLock.unlock()
        
        if shouldStopCamera {
            stopCameraCapture()
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Communication & State Management (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Implement Reliable Status Communication
**Goal**: Replace one-way notifications with acknowledged status system

**App Group UserDefaults Keys**:
- `HL.ext.status`: String enum (idle|starting|streaming|stopping|error)
- `HL.ext.lastHeartbeat`: TimeInterval (health monitoring)
- `HL.selectedDeviceID`: String (camera selection)
- `HL.autoStartCamera`: Bool (user preference, default: true)

**Darwin Notifications** (with acknowledgment):
- App → Extension: `.HL.request.start`, `.HL.request.stop`, `.HL.request.switchDevice`
- Extension → App: `.HL.status.changed` (triggers app to read UserDefaults)

**Implementation**:
- Extension writes status on every state transition
- Main app observes status changes, updates UI accordingly
- Replace hardcoded delays with actual status polling

#### 2.2 Add Auto-Start Feature
**Goal**: Seamless Google Meet integration without manual "Start Camera" button

**Implementation**:
```swift
func startStreaming() {
    _streamingCounter += 1
    
    // Always start timer for virtual camera frames
    if _timer == nil {
        setupFrameGenerationTimer()
    }
    
    // Check user preference and current state
    let autoStartEnabled = UserDefaults(suiteName: Identifiers.appGroup)?.bool(forKey: "HL.autoStartCamera") ?? true
    
    _streamStateLock.lock()
    let shouldStartCamera = _isAppControlledStreaming || (autoStartEnabled && !isCapturing)
    _streamStateLock.unlock()
    
    if shouldStartCamera && autoStartEnabled && !isCapturing {
        // Auto-start: user enabled seamless experience
        _streamStateLock.lock()
        _isAppControlledStreaming = true
        _streamStateLock.unlock()
        
        startCameraCapture()
        extensionLogger.debug("🎯 Auto-started camera for external app")
    } else if shouldStartCamera {
        startCameraCapture()
    } else {
        extensionLogger.debug("Showing splash - waiting for manual start or auto-start enabled")
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Code Cleanup & Optimization (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Remove Redundant Manager Classes

**Remove `CustomPropertyManager`**:
- Fold device detection into `ExtensionService`
- Use direct AVCaptureDevice queries instead of placeholder IDs
- Simplify extension status checking

**Remove `OutputImageManager`**:
- Main app will use self-preview from virtual camera
- If preview frame needed elsewhere, handle directly in `CameraService`
- Eliminate single-property wrapper class

**Simplify `ExtensionService`**:
- Use UserDefaults status instead of log text parsing
- Remove complex polling, use Darwin notifications + status observation
- Clean up device scan fallbacks

#### 3.2 Harden `CaptureSessionManager` (Extension-Only)
**Goal**: Rock-solid camera capture for extension

**Improvements**:
- Fix device selection: use stable `uniqueID` over localized names
- Serialize permission requests to avoid race conditions  
- Proper UserDefaults integration for device selection
- Comprehensive error recovery and session cleanup
- Handle device switching during active streaming

**Implementation**:
```swift
private func configureCaptureSession() -> Bool {
    // Read selected device from UserDefaults instead of discovery
    guard let selectedDeviceID = UserDefaults(suiteName: Identifiers.appGroup)?.string(forKey: "HL.selectedDeviceID") else {
        logger.error("No selected device ID in UserDefaults")
        return false
    }
    
    // Find device by stable uniqueID, not localized name
    guard let device = discoverySession.devices.first(where: { $0.uniqueID == selectedDeviceID }) else {
        logger.error("Selected device not found: \(selectedDeviceID)")
        return false
    }
    
    // ... rest of configuration
}
```

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Polish (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Add Comprehensive Error Handling

**Health Checks**:
- Extension heartbeat every 2 seconds while streaming
- Detect no frames rendered for >5 seconds → attempt recovery
- Camera permission revoked → transition to error state
- Device busy errors → retry with exponential backoff

**Error Recovery**:
- Lightweight recovery: reconnect video output
- Full recovery: rebuild entire capture session
- User-facing error messages with recovery actions

#### 4.2 Performance Optimizations

**Lazy Resource Management**:
- No frame timer when idle (_streamingCounter = 0)
- Release CVPixelBuffer pools when stopping
- Reuse CIContext and rendering resources

**Efficient Frame Generation**:
- Atomic overlay config snapshots (avoid mid-frame mutations)
- Buffer pool optimization for different camera resolutions
- Reduce overlay render frequency when not changing

#### 4.3 Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics

**Structured Logging**:
```swift
private func logStateTransition(from: ExtensionState, to: ExtensionState, trigger: String) {
    extensionLogger.info("State: \(from.rawValue) → \(to.rawValue) (trigger: \(trigger))")
}
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Frame generation timing
- Memory usage tracking
- Device switch duration
- Overlay render performance
